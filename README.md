# AirBNB
Repository for code/data used for a competitive predictive modeling project to predict AirBNB ratings

## Background
Competitive team project to predict AirBNB ratings from a training set. The data includes the rating for the BNB property, along with 50 additional columns of potentially useful data. The team involved three people: myself (Allen Butt), Mitchell Zufelt, and Chris Dunning. We initially split the project as follows:

-   Chris - Initial Data Cleaning
-   Mitch - Text Analysis
-   Allen - Unravelling the “Accomodations” column, and ensembling the prediction models

## Outcome
The project went well, with our team acquiring the highest score in the validation set, and the third highest in the testing set. Many aspects of the project could be improved, especially performance-wise, although the end result of the ensembling method was strong.
